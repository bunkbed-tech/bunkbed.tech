# website

www.bunkbed.tech

A homepage to show off all our projects, documentation, and blog posts to track development.

## Ideas

- Host on-premises instead of using a cloud provider
- Until an on-premises option can be achieved, use a Hetzner VPS
- Build the website using the popular Svelte-kit framework
